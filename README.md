This is an Arduino library for 12-bit MAX6675 K-Thermocouple to Digital Converter with Cold Junction Compensation & maximum sampling rate  about 4..5Hz

- K-type thermocouples have an absolute accuracy of around ±2°C
- Measurement tempereture range 0°C...+1024°C with 0.25°C resolution
- Cold junction compensation range -20°C...+85°C
- Keep k-type thermocouple cold junction and MAX6675 at the same temperature
- Avoid placing heat-generating devices or components near the chip
  because this may produce errors
